<b>Online Food Store</b> ðŸŒ±

<b>Problem statement</b>
<br>
  â€“ New local food retailer chain wants to implement delivery services as part of their business plan.  

You are responsible to develop the website:
- where customer can purchase organic food online (e.g. fruits, vegetables, and other grocery items) into a virtual shopping cart.
- Pay for it online and have it delivered to their home.  
- Inventory, customer, transactions are processed and stored in RDBMS.

*Special note: If the weight of the total order is less than 20 pounds, delivery is free.  Otherwise you will 
add a delivery charge of $5 to the order.  You need to track the weight of each food item in the database 
and shopping cart.
